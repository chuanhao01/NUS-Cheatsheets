Quick and dirty README.
Cheatsheet made with [typst](https://typst.app/).

## Development

My setup is using vscode with just the [Tinymist](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=myriad-dreamin.tinymist) extension.
I use the features `Typst Preview: Preview Opened file in Browser` and `Typst: Export the opened file as PDF`.
